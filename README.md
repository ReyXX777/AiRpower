Project Description: AiRpower // 2024
Project Overview
AiRpower // 2024 aims to create a user-friendly website that forecasts power consumption based on a budget set by the user. This innovative platform leverages IoT integration, real-time data analysis, and advanced forecasting algorithms to help users manage their electricity usage and expenses effectively.

Key Features
Budget Input:

Users can enter their desired monthly electricity budget into a straightforward input box on the website.

Real-Time Data Integration:

The website connects to users' electric meters via IoT technology to gather real-time power consumption data.

Data Analysis & Forecasting:

The collected data is fed into a sophisticated data analyzer that uses statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to forecast future power consumption.

Budget Prediction:

Based on current usage patterns, the website predicts whether users will exceed or save on their budget by the end of the month. It provides specific estimates of potential overage or savings.

User Experience Flow
Opening the App:

Users log in to the AiRpower // 2024 website.

They are greeted with a clean, intuitive interface designed for ease of use.

Setting the Budget:

Users enter their desired budget for the month in the budget input box.

Data Processing:

The system automatically starts collecting real-time data from the user's electric meter through IoT integration.

Analysis & Forecasting:

The real-time data is continuously fed into the data analyzer.

The system uses techniques like ARIMA, Support Vector Regression, Random Forests, and LSTM to forecast future consumption.

Displaying Results:

The website displays a prediction on whether the user will exceed their budget or save money, based on current usage rates.

Users receive detailed information on potential overage or savings amounts.

Recommendations:

To help users stay within budget, the website offers personalized recommendations for reducing power consumption.
